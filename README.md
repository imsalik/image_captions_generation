# Image Caption Generation

This repository contains the code and resources for generating captions for images using deep learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.


## Introduction
The Image Caption Generation project aims to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. This can be useful for various applications such as accessibility, content creation, and more.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imsalik/image_captions_generation.git
    cd image_captions_generation
    ```
    
## Model Architecture
The model used in this project is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The CNN is used to extract features from the images, and the RNN (specifically an LSTM) is used to generate the captions based on these features.

## Dataset
The project uses the Flickr8k dataset, which contains 8,000 images each with five different captions. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and validation sets.
